# [WIP] Paster -- universal asynchronous pastebin CLI

For your convenience [I explored](https://github.com/Nakilon/pcbr-demo/blob/master/pastebins.txt) the features of a few dozen of pastebin services and realised that people want different sets of them so I ~~made~~ am making a CLI that asks what exactly you want and then tries to upload your paste to everywhere asynchronously printing the returned links until done or until you stop the process by `^C`.
